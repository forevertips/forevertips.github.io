A3. Clearing the cache will not delete any important data or settings from your device. The only thing that will be affected is the app&rsquo;s data stored in the cache, such as user settings and temporary files. This data will be deleted, but the app will regenerate it the next time it is used.</p><p>Q4. Is it safe to clear the cache?
A4. Yes, it is safe to clear the cache on your Android device. Clearing the cache will not delete any important data or settings from your device, and it will not affect the performance of the device.</p><p>Q5. What is the best way to clear the cache on my Android device?
