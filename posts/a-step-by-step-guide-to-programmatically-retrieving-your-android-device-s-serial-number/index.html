String serial = Build.SERIAL; This variable will contain the serial number of the device.</p><p>Third, if you need additional information about the device, use the TelephonyManager class which provides access to information about the device&rsquo;s phone and other network related features. You can retrieve the TelephonyManager like this: TelephonyManager tManager = (TelephonyManager)getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);</p><p>Fourth, to obtain the device&rsquo;s phone number, use the following method from the TelephonyManager class. String phoneNumber = tManager.getLine1Number(); This method will return the device&rsquo;s phone number.</p><p>Following these steps will allow you to programmatically retrieve the serial number of your Android device.</p><h3 id=2-retrieving-serial-number-programmatically>2. Retrieving Serial Number Programmatically<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-retrieving-serial-number-programmatically>#</a></h3><p>Android devices are designed to be universally accessible with user-friendly application program interfaces (APIs) that allow developers to access features and functions that facilitate the usage of the device. One of the common tasks that an Android developer may need to perform is to get the serial number of an Android device programmatically. Here are the steps to help you retrieve the serial number programmatically:</p><p>First, you need to add the necessary permission to your application manifest. You can add the READ_PHONE_STATE permission by adding the following line of code to your application manifest: <uses-permission android:name=android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE/></p><p>Second, you can programmatically get the serial number of an Android device in your application code. To do this, you can use the getSerial() method which is available as part of the TelephonyManager class. The following code can be used to get the serial number programmatically:
String serialNumber = ((TelephonyManager) context.getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE)).getSerial();</p><p>Third, you can also get the serial number programmatically using the unique device ID. You can get the unique device ID with the help of the Settings.Secure class. The following code can be used to get the unique device ID programmatically:
String deviceId = Settings.Secure.getString(context.getContentResolver(), Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID);</p><p>Finally, you can also get the serial number programmatically from the system properties. You can use the getProperty() method of the System class to get the serial number. The following code can be used to get the serial number programmatically from the system properties:
String serial = System.getProperty(ro.serialno);</p><h2 id=3-conclusion>3.
