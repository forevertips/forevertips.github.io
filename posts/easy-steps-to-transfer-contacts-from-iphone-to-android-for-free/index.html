Transferring your contacts from your iPhone to your Android device is a must. Luckily, it’s an easy process that you can do in just a few steps. Here’s a guide on how to transfer contacts from iPhone to Android for free using Bluetooth or iCloud.

Then, open the Contacts app on your Android device and select “Add Account”. Log into your iCloud account and select “Contacts”. Your contacts should then be transferred to your Android device.
You can also transfer contacts from your iPhone to your Android device using a USB cable, but this requires additional software and can be a bit more complicated.
