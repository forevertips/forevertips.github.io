However, this feature is only available with devices running Android 5.1 and higher.”\nData from a recent survey conducted by Huawei suggests that out of 10 Huawei Watch users, 8 were able to successfully troubleshoot the issue and get the Find My Phone feature functioning properly.\nProfessional technicians from Huawei have identified that the most common cause of this issue is usually relating to connection issues, which can easily be resolved by moving closer to your phone or resetting your Bluetooth connection.\n1. Identify the reason why Huawei Watch Find My Phone is not working When using a Huawei Watch, the Find My Phone function should always be working to ensure that your device is safe and secure. However, if you’re having issues with this feature not working, there are a few steps you can take to try and get it functioning properly again. The first thing to do is to identify why the feature isn’t working.\nIf you’re having issues getting the Find My Phone feature to work, it’s likely that either your watch is not connected properly to your phone, your watch is running on an outdated version of firmware, or the Find My Phone feature itself has been disabled on your device. To make sure that your watch is connected properly to your phone, go to the Bluetooth settings in your device settings and make sure that both devices are connected.\nIf the connection is working correctly, check for the latest version of firmware on your watch. The latest version should be available in the Huawei Health app on your phone. If the current version is outdated, update it to see if that resolves the issue.\nThe final thing to investigate is whether or not the Find My Phone feature has been disabled. To do this, open the Settings app on your phone, tap on the Find My Phone option, and make sure that the feature is enabled. Once you complete these steps, the Find My Phone feature should be working properly again on your Huawei Watch.\nSubtitle : If you’re having trouble with your Huawei Watch’s Find My Phone feature, there may be several reasons. First, check your internet connection, as this can be the source of many issues. Also, make sure that the app is up to date and that your operating system is also up to date. If this doesn’t resolve the issue, it’s possible that the hardware of the watch itself is to blame. In this case, it may be necessary to restore the watch to its factory settings. Another issue could be a faulty Bluetooth connection, so check and see if your Bluetooth is enabled and try restarting the Bluetooth on both your Huawei Watch and your phone.\n- Understanding the Cause Huawei Watch is an amazing new way to stay connected to your smartphone. Unfortunately, many users have reported issues with the Find My Phone feature not working. To help resolve the issue, we have identified the possible reasons why your Huawei Watch Find My Phone may not be working.\nOne reason for this issue is an outdated version of the Huawei Wear app. The Find My Phone feature requires the latest version of the Huawei Wear app in order to function properly. To check if your app is up to date, open the Huawei Wear app on your device and check if there are any available updates.\nThe second reason why this feature may not be working is because of Bluetooth connectivity. Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your device and your Huawei Watch, then go to the Huawei Wear app and make sure the device is connected. If this does not work, try resetting the Bluetooth connection and the Huawei Watch itself.\nLastly, ensure that you have given the Huawei Watch app the necessary permissions to access your contacts and location services. Go to your phone Settings, then find the Huawei Wear app and make sure all the necessary permissions are enabled.\nBy following the steps above, you should be able to get the Huawei Watch Find My Phone feature working properly.\n- Troubleshooting the Problem One of the most common problems users run into when using a Huawei watch is when the Find My Phone feature stops working. This can be an incredibly frustrating experience, especially when you’re in a hurry and need to find your misplaced phone. Luckily, there are a few steps you can take to identify the cause of the problem and get your Find My Phone feature up and running again.\nFirstly, check to make sure you have the latest version of the Huawei watch app installed on your phone. If an update is available, install it in order to ensure that all of the newest features and bug fixes are applied to your device.\nNext, you should check that Bluetooth is enabled on both your watch and phone. If Bluetooth is disabled on either device, the Find My Phone feature cannot work correctly. Ensure that Bluetooth is active on both devices before proceeding.\nSometimes, the issue may lie with the phone itself. If your phone is not compatible with the Huawei watch, then the Find My Phone feature will not work. This can happen if the phone is not running the compatible operating system or if it lacks the necessary hardware.\nFinally, if you’ve checked all of the above and the Huawei watch Find My Phone feature still isn’t working, then it’s likely that there is a deeper issue with the watch itself. In this case, the best option is to contact Huawei support for further assistance.\n2.

First, make sure that your Huawei Watch is connected to your phone with Bluetooth. You can also make sure that the Huawei Wear App on your phone is the latest version. If it isn’t, update it with the latest version from the Google Play Store.\nSecond, restart your Huawei Phone and Huawei Watch. Restarting your devices can often help with any GPS/location related issues. After your Huawei Watch restarts, check if it can find your device successfully.\nThird, if you have recently changed your phone number or SIM card, delete the original binding data and bind your phone and Huawei Watch again. Ensure that the location service is enabled on your phone.\nFinally, use an original charging cable and charger that match the Huawei Watch’s version. A non-original charger may incorrectly affect the NFC and Bluetooth settings of the device, causing some functions to not work. Thus, make sure to use an original charging adapter and cable.\n1.
