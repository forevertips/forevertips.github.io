By using these applications, you can easily record both incoming and outgoing calls on your Android device without having to root it.</p><p>Most of these applications come with a variety of features like automatic call recording, playback, cloud integration, and more. Before you start, make sure that the application is trustworthy and won’t store your data without your knowledge. Additionally, make sure that the app is compatible with your Android device, as not all apps will work on all devices.</p><p>Once you’ve found an app that you trust and is compatible with your device, you’ll need to install it. The installation process is usually quite straightforward, and it’s usually just a matter of following the instructions on the app’s website or app store. After that, you’ll need to select the contact(s) whose calls you want to record.</p><p>Then, you’ll need to configure the app as per your needs. Depending on the application, you may be able to choose between automatic or manual call recording. You may also be able to choose whether or not you want the recording to be saved on the cloud. Once you’ve finished configuring the app, just hit the record button and you’re ready to start recording calls without anyone knowing!</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5qltVD5_s4A style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1 : What are the five tips for recording Android calls without others knowing?
