However, there is a way for you to find your device by using your phone&rsquo;s International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number. The IMEI is a unique 15-digit serial number that is used to identify your mobile device. Here&rsquo;s how to track a lost non-Android device using the IMEI number.</p><p>First, you need to locate your phone&rsquo;s IMEI number. This can be found on the back of the device itself, the box that the device came with, or when you type *#06# on the device&rsquo;s keypad. Once you have the number, contact your mobile service provider and ask them to track your device. They will need the IMEI number in order to do this.</p><p>Once the mobile service provider has confirmed that they can track your device, you will need to provide them with your personal information, such as your name, address, and phone number. This is so they can verify your identity and ensure that the tracking is done legally.</p><p>The mobile service provider will then use a specialized tracking system to find the exact location of your device. This system can track mobile phones even if they are switched off or not in range of a cellular network. Once the device has been located, the service provider will contact you to let you know the location.</p><p>Finally, you can contact the authorities to help you retrieve your lost phone. The IMEI number will help them to locate your device and get it back to you. With this information, you can now track a lost non-Android device with ease and peace of mind.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vZZmMTUQk8 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.
