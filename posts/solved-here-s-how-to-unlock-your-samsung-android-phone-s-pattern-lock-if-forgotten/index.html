Warnings to Consider Before Unlocking To unlock your Samsung android phone pattern if forgotten, first, you have to enter a wrong pattern lock for 5 times. This will induce a thirty seconds delay before you can enter a new pattern lock. After the delay, you will see the option “Forgot pattern?” appear on the bottom right of the screen.

Also, if you are unable to unlock your device after 5 attempts, you will need to wait for thirty seconds before you can enter another unlock pattern.\nYou should also make sure to properly backup your data before attempting to unlock your device.

Select the option “unlock my device” to continue. Now you should be able to unlock your device by entering a new pattern lock.</p><p>It is important to remember that if you forget your pattern lock, you will need access to the Google account credentials that were used to set up the device. If you don’t remember your Google account details, you won’t be able to unlock the device. Also, if you are unable to unlock your device after 5 attempts, you will need to wait for thirty seconds before you can enter another unlock pattern.</p><p>You should also make sure to properly backup your data before attempting to unlock your device. A factory reset will erase all data stored on your device and you won’t be able to recover it without a backup. Additionally, make sure to use a strong and unique pattern lock. This will help you protect your device from unauthorized access and keeps your data secure.</p><p>Finally, do not share your pattern lock with anyone else. It is important to keep it private as it is the only way to secure your device. To sum up, unlocking your Samsung android pattern lock can be done by entering a wrong pattern 5 times, then entering your Google Account credentials followed by the option “unlock my device”. Remember to properly backup your device, use a strong and unique pattern lock, and always keep it private.</p><h2 id=3-conclusion>3.
