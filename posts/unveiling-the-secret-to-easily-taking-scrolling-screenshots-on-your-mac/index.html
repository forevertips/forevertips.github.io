Different types of Screenshot Taking a screenshot on a Mac is a great way to capture the step-by-step instructions for a tutorial or to save an image to share with others. Depending on your needs, you may want to capture the entire page or just the portion that fits neatly on the screen. Screenshots come in two types: whole page screenshots and scrolling screenshots. Here, we will explore the differences between these two types of screenshots and how to take them on a Mac.\nThe whole page screenshot is the simplest type of screenshot to take on a Mac.

To take a screenshot of a specific window, press Command-Shift-4 and drag your cursor over the window.\nThe other type of screenshot is the scrolling screenshot.

Your Mac will then scroll down and capture the page as a series of images. To piece them together, right-click on any image and select “Open with Preview”.

If you wanted to take a screenshot of a specific area on your Mac’s screen, you can press Command+Shift+4 and then drag your cursor to determine the area that you want to capture.

There are several ways to do this, depending on what you need in the screenshot. Here are three of the most common types of screenshots on a Mac that you can take while scrolling.\nThe first type of screenshot is the regular full-page capture. This method allows you to take a screenshot of your entire screen regardless of how long it is.

This is a way of capturing only a portion of a website or document. To take this type of screenshot, press Shift + Command + 4 and drag a box across the area you want to capture.\nThe third type of screenshot is the select window capture. This allows you to capture an entire window including its contents, regardless of how long it is. To take this type of screenshot, press Command + Shift + 4 and then press the Spacebar. The cursor will turn into a camera icon and you can simply click on any window you want to capture.\nUsing these three types of screenshots, you can take full-page, partial, and select window screenshots of any webpage or document while scrolling on a Mac.\n3.

Here, we will explore the differences between these two types of screenshots and how to take them on a Mac.</p><p>The whole page screenshot is the simplest type of screenshot to take on a Mac. It captures the entire page, no matter how long it is, in one snapshot. To take a whole page screenshot, press Command-Shift-3 to capture your entire screen. To take a screenshot of a specific window, press Command-Shift-4 and drag your cursor over the window.</p><p>The other type of screenshot is the scrolling screenshot. Taking a scrolling screenshot is useful when you want to save an article or web page that&rsquo;s too long to fit on one page. To take a scrolling screenshot on a Mac, press the Command-Shift-4-Space bar combination and select the window you want to capture. Your Mac will then scroll down and capture the page as a series of images. To piece them together, right-click on any image and select “Open with Preview”. Select all of the screenshots in the Preview window and go to Tools > Combine into Single Page.</p><p>Knowing the difference between the two types of screenshot and when to use them can be very useful. Screenshots are helpful for making tutorials and sharing images online. With the right tools and the right command, it is easy to take scrolling screenshots on a Mac.</p><h3 id=1-taking-screenshots-on-mac>1.
