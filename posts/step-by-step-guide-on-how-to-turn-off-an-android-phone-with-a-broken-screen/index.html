The first is to press and hold the power button until the device turns off and the second is to remove the battery from the phone.” (Gizmodo)\nI. Introduction Many Android users have experienced broken screens on their phones, and they may not know how to turn their phone off if the touchscreen isn’t responding. This step-by-step guide will show you how to turn off an Android phone with a broken screen. First, try using the regular shut down button on the device. If that fails, you can use the hardware keys to force the device to shut down. Finally, you can remove the battery to completely shut off the phone.\nStart by pressing and holding the power button until a pop-up menu appears. You should see a “Power off” option that you can select. If the power button does not respond, you will need to use the hardware keys of your device. Depending on the make and model of your device, you may need to press the volume down and power buttons simultaneously. This combination should bring up the power off menu.\nIf the power button and hardware keys do not respond, you can remove the battery to shut down the device. On many Android devices, the battery is located in the back of the phone, and can be removed by simply pulling it out. Once the battery is removed, the device will no longer be powered on.\nReplace the battery and turn on your device. You should be able to access the lock screen or home screen. If the device is still unresponsive, you may need to contact a service provider or professional to further diagnose the issue. Following these steps should help you turn off your Android phone with a broken screen.\n1. Identify the phone Type If you have an Android smartphone with a broken screen, it can be difficult to turn it off. However, it is possible to turn off your device without using the screen. All you need is a working USB cable and a computer with a USB port. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to turn off your Android phone with a broken screen.\nFirst, connect your phone to the USB port of your PC or laptop. Then go to the “Settings” menu and select the “Developer Options” option. Make sure that the “USB debugging” option is enabled. This will allow your device to be detected by your PC.\nNext, open the command prompt on your PC. Type in adb devices” to check if your device is connected properly.

Find a Way to Disable the Phone It can be a headache trying to figure out how to turn off an Android phone with a broken screen. The most important thing to remember is that it can be done. There are two ways to do this, either by using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) or by using physical buttons on the phone. With either method, you’ll be able to turn off your Android phone without the need for a working display.\nThe fastest and easiest way to turn off an Android phone with a broken screen is to use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). ADB is a tool that allows for communication between your computer and your Android device. To do this, you’ll need to install the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) and the appropriate USB drivers for your model on your computer. Once this is done, plug the phone into the computer and use ADB commands to turn off the device.\nFor those who cannot access the Android SDK or ADB commands, the second option to turn off an Android phone with a broken screen is to use the physical buttons. Every Android phone has a combination of buttons that will turn the phone off. On most phones, this is a combination of the power and volume buttons. To turn the phone off, press and hold both buttons until the phone shuts off.\nRegardless of which method you use, it’s important to remember that this will not fix the broken screen. However, these two methods can help to make the process of turning off an Android phone with a broken screen easier.\nII.
